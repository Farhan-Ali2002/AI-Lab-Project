# Intrusion detection systems (IDS)
## Network Trafficking Data Analysis (AI-Lab-Project)

Network security is a critical concern in today's digital age, where cyber threats are becoming increasingly sophisticated and pervasive. Intrusion detection systems (IDS) are essential tools for detecting and mitigating such threats, and machine learning algorithms have shown great promise in this domain. In this report, we present our analysis of a network traffic dataset consisting of 43 features related to network activity, including duration, protocol type,service and source and destination bytes. We will be discussing all the features or columns in details in the next section. The dataset includes instances of various types of attacks, and the goal of our analysis is to build a machine learning model that can accurately classify these attacks. We first describe the preprocessing and feature engineering steps we performed on the dataset to prepare it for modeling. We then present the results of our experiments with different machine learning algorithms and parameter settings, and provide insights into the most effective approaches for intrusion detection using this dataset. Overall, our study aims to contribute to the development of more robust and effective IDS systems for network security.
